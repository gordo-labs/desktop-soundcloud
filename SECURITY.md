# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We aim to keep the latest minor release secure. Older releases may not receive fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead, email the maintainers with details and a proof of concept if possible. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work with you on a fix and coordinated disclosure.

## Guidelines
- Do not test against production SoundCloud services in a way that violates their terms.
- Avoid automated scanning that could disrupt users.
- Provide steps to reproduce, affected versions/OS, and any relevant logs.
