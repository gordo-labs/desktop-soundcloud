- Cold start (<2s), reported idle memory.
- SoundCloud login and persistence after restart.
- Playback: play/pause/next/prev with shortcuts and media keys.
- External links open in the system browser.
- Tray: minimise to tray, restore, quit.
- Track notifications and metadata updates.
- Linux: MPRIS visible in system players.
- Windows: SMTC visible (Win+P/OSD), macOS: Now Playing if implemented.
- Security: prevent navigation outside allowed domains; restricted APIs.
Deliver: step-by-step checklist.
